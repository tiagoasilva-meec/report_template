\indent MPEG audio standardizes the type of information that an encoder has to produce and write to MPEG conformant bitstream, as well as how the decoder has to process the information to regain the encoded sound.

Knowing the MPEG standards have an extremely wide range of customers who need digital audio and video package, the goal of this work is to develop an IP core to encode MPEG1/2 layer II, using a RISC-V processor and hardware accelerators. The fact that there are a few IP cores for encoding MP2 is a strong motivation for this work.

The work will be developed using the IOb-SoC, a System-on-Chip template comprising an open-source RISC-V processor, provided by \textit{IObundle Lda}. 
With this SoC, it will be possible to implement a MPEG encoder concerning the ISO/IEC 11172 international standard, which specifies the coded representation of high-quality audio for storage media. The TwoLAME repository, an optimized MPEG Audio Layer 2 encoder based on the ISO/IEC 11172 and portions of LAME, provides the algorithm for the encoder.

The last stage of development will be hardware acceleration, with the program running on IOb-SoC in addition to specialized hardware components.
