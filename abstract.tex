\hspace{0.4cm} This thesis introduces a floating-point Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG)-1/2 Layer II Audio encoder, offering high accuracy at the cost of increased silicon area in a market with limited commercial MPEG-1/2 Layer II Intellectual Property (IP) cores.
The software architecture features the \textit{VexRiscv} Central Processing Unit (CPU) in an IOb-SoC setup, using the \textit{TwoLAME} encoding algorithm. Software optimizations are applied. Profiling with a \textit{TIMER} peripheral highlights the significant impact of the \textit{psycho\_3\_threshold} function, accounting for 37\% to 64\% of execution time.
On the hardware side, the \textit{Versat} accelerator is integrated into IOb-SoC to speed up the \textit{psycho\_3\_threshold} function. Two hardware accelerators are developed, \textit{spectrum\_search} and \textit{masking\_threshold}, addressing different parts of the \textit{psycho\_3\_threshold} function. The field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation shows increased Total Look Up Tables (LUTs), LUTRAMs, Flip-Flops, and Digital Signal Processor (DSP) Blocks.
The execution time of \textit{psycho\_3\_threshold} function is significantly reduced with the \textit{spectrum\_search} accelerator.
Comparing the achieved speedup with the required speedup for real-time encoding, some input files come close to meeting the requirements. While the first file, with a small number of frames, still falls short, the remaining files, especially the one representing the worst-case scenario, show promising results.
