This work introduces an MPEG-1/2 Layer II Audio encoder for a RISC-V embedded
architecture featuring a reconfigurable hardware accelerator. The software uses
the TwoLAME encoder open-source library ported to the system. Although such
systems are standard on commercial embedded processors such as ARM, this work is
the first to present a RISC-V implementation. The advantage is that the RISC-V
architecture is an open specification with a few open-source hardware designs
available. A hardware accelerator allows the system to run on low-frequency
environments like an FPGA device. The system hardware is based on IOb-SoC, an
open-source RISC-V SoC platform written in Verilog. The VexRiscv CPU has been
chosen, and the hardware accelerator has been implemented using the Versat
open-source reconfigurable accelerator design tool. The work features software
optimizations and two hardware accelerators to accelerate the computation of the
psychoacoustic model of the algorithm. The achieved performance is 2.4x slower
than real-time for a system running at 100MHz, which indicates that an
implementation for 240MHz would meet the goal.
