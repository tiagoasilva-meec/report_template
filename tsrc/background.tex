\subsection{MPEG-1/2 Layers I/II}

The Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) is a working group that sets standards for media coding, established by International Organization for Standardization (ISO)~\cite{iso} and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)~\cite{iec}. Thus, the MPEG standard is a set of specifications for audio and video compression, containing two variations (among others), MPEG-1 and MPEG-2. Both variations cover audio and video, but since this work is focused on audio, the relevant standards are MPEG-1 Audio and MPEG-2 Audio.
%is a working group of ISO/IEC with the mission to develop standards for coded representation of digital audio and video and related data.

The MPEG-1 Audio, defined by ISO/IEC 11172-3~\cite{11172} (explained in the next section), standardizes the information that an audio encoder must produce to write a bitstream conformant with the standard requirements. Moreover, it standardizes how an audio decoder has to parse, decompress, and resynthesize the information to reconstruct the original audio stream.

This standard performs perceptual audio coding, which does not attempt to retain the input signal exactly after encoding and decoding. Instead, it ensures that the output signal sounds the same to a human listener. %, by eliminating the parts of the input signal that are irrelevant to the human ear 
More precisely, an MPEG-1 audio encoder transforms the sound signal into the frequency domain, eliminates the frequency components that are masked by stronger frequency components, and packages the analyzed signal into a compressed audio bitstream.

%working principle
Focusing on the encoding process, the primary psychoacoustic effect is called "auditory masking", where parts of a signal are not audible due to the function of the human auditory system. For example, if there is a sound that consists mainly of one frequency, all other sounds that consist of a close frequency but are much quieter will not be heard. \\
%where exploiting the limitations of perception and removal of irrelevance is key to achieving a significant reduction in bitrate while preserving subjective audio quality.
Considering this, the parts of the signal that are masked are commonly called irrelevant, as opposed to the redundant parts which are removed. % by a lossless coding operation 
To eliminate this irrelevancy, the encoder contains a \textbf{psychoacoustic model} which analyzes the input signals within consecutive time blocks and determines, for each block, the spectral components of the input audio signal (by applying a \textbf{frequency transform}). Then, it models the masking properties of the human auditory system, and estimates the noise level for each frequency band, usually called "threshold of masking". 
In parallel, the input signal is fed through a time-to-frequency mapping, resulting in spectrum components for subsequent coding. \\
Finally, in the \textbf{quantization and coding} stage, the encoder tries to allocate the available number of data bits, meeting both the bitrate and masking requirements ("threshold of masking"). The information on how the bits are distributed over the spectrum is contained in the bitstream as side information.

%layers
The MPEG-1 standardizes three different coding schemes, namely Layer I, Layer II, and Layer III, with the first two layers being the relevant ones in this work.
Layer I has the lowest complexity and is specifically suitable for applications where the encoder complexity plays an important role.
Layer II requires a more complex encoder and decoder, being directed towards one-to-many applications, i.e. one encoder serves many decoders. 

Compared to Layer I, Layer II can remove more of the signal redundancy and apply the psychoacoustic threshold more efficiently.
%bitstream
In Layer II, the digitized audio signal is divided up into blocks of 1152 samples, with each block being encoded within one MPEG-1 audio frame.
Therefore, an MPEG-1 audio stream consists of consecutive audio frames, each one containing a header and the encoded data. The header contains general information, such as MPEG Layer, sampling frequency, number of channels, etc. Although most of this information may be the same for all frames, MPEG decided to give each audio frame a header to simplify synchronization and bitstream editing.

%MPEG-2
All the previous information describes one variation of MPEG, MPEG-1 Audio. This variation represents the first phase of dealing with mono and two-channel stereo sound coding, at sampling frequencies commonly used for high-quality audio (48, 44.1, and 32 kHz).\\
In addition, there is a second variation, MPEG-2 Audio, which includes three main points.
The first point is the extension of MPEG-1 to lower sampling frequencies (16 kHz, 22.05 kHz, and 24 kHz), providing better sound quality at very low bit rates.
The second point is the backward-compatible (BC) extension of MPEG-1 to multichannel sound, supporting up to 5 full bandwidth channels plus one low-frequency enhancement channel. The MPEG-2 BC stream adheres to the structure of a MPEG-1 bitstream, meaning that a MPEG-2 BC stream can be read and interpreted by a MPEG-1 audio decoder.
The third and last point is a new coding scheme called Advanced Audio Coding (AAC), which is more efficient and presents higher quality.
 
%applications
Today, the MPEG-1 Audio standard is the most widely compatible lossy audio format in the world, thanks to technical merits and excellent audio quality performance.
Within the professional and consumer market, four fields of applications can be identified, namely broadcasting, storage, multimedia, and telecommunication. %This variety of applications is possible because of the big range of bitrates and the numerous configurations allowed in MPEG-1. \\

\subsection{MPEG-1/2 Layers I/II IP cores}

Knowing the wide range of customers that need digital audio, belonging to all industries, this work proposes developing an IP core to encode MPEG-1/2 Layer II, using a RISC-V processor and hardware accelerators.
 
An intellectual property core (IP core) consists in a block of logic or data that is used in a semiconductor chip when making a field-programmable gate array (FPGA)~\cite{fpga} or application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC)~\cite{asic}.
Therefore, IP cores are usually the property of a particular person or company, being created throughout the design process and eventually turned into components for reuse. Third-party IPs can also be purchased and implemented into designs. 

Ideally, an IP core should be entirely portable, meaning it should be possible to insert it into any vendor technology or design methodology. However, this is not always the case, existing two main categories of IP cores, soft IP core, and hard IP core.\\
A soft IP core is generally offered as a synthesizable RTL model. It is developed in a hardware description language like SystemVerilog~\cite{ieee:systemVerilog} or VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL)~\cite{ieee:vhdl}, or can occasionally be provided synthesized with a gate-level netlist. One advantage of this IP is the possibility to customize during the physical design phase and map to any process technology.\\
A hard IP core has logic and physical implementation, meaning that its physical layout is finished and fixed in a particular process technology.
One advantage of this core is the better predictability of chip timing performance and area for its technology. 

A company that purchases an IP core license usually receives everything that's required to design, test, and implement the core in its product. It may also receive logic and test patterns, signal specifications, design notes, and a list of known bugs or limitations.

%introduction for the examples
