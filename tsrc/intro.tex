\subsection{Topic overview}
%MPEG importance
The Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) is a working group that sets standards
for media coding, established by International Organization for Standardization
(ISO)~\cite{iso} and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)~\cite{iec}.
Within the professional and consumer market, four fields of applications can be
identified, namely broadcasting, storage, multimedia, and telecommunication.

%MPEG, 1 e 2, audio
The MPEG standard includes two variations, MPEG-1 and MPEG-2, with both covering
audio and video compression.  Today, MPEG-1 Audio is the most widely compatible
lossy audio format in the world. It standardizes the information that an audio
encoder must produce to write a bitstream conformant to the standard
requirements.  Nonetheless, MPEG-2 Audio is an extension of the first variation,
providing lower sampling frequencies, backward compatibility, and a more
advanced coding scheme.\\

%layers
The MPEG standard also differentiates three coding schemes, called Layer I,
Layer II, and Layer III.  The first two layers are the most relevant ones. Layer
I has the lowest complexity, while Layer II requires a more complex encoder and
decoder, being directed towards one-to-many applications. These formats are
regulated by the ISO/IEC 11172 international standard~\cite{xxxx}, which
specifies the coded representation of high-quality audio for storage media.

\subsection{Motivation}

Since its formation in 1988, the MPEG has made an indelible mark on the
transition from analog to digital video. As proof, the annual value of products
and services that rely on MPEG standards is approximately 2\% of the world's
gross product.

An increasing number of broadcasting applications are based on MPEG technology,
such as Digital Satellite System (DSS)~\cite{dss}, Digital Audio Broadcast
(DAB)~\cite{dab}, and Digital Video Broadcast (DVB)~\cite{dvb}. To integrate an
MPEG-1/2 Layer II encoder in a system, one has the following two options.

One option is buying an encoder chip, for example, the \textit{CX23415 MPEG-2
  Codec}~\cite{cx23415}, \textit{MPEG-2 Encoder CW-4888}~\cite{cw4888}, or the
\textit{Futura II ASI+IP}~\cite{futura}. For the user, this means an additional
chip on the board, increasing its area/volume, weight, and power
consumption. Another option is to use a software encoder, which requires a
Central Processing Unit (CPU), either one already available, or an additional
processor chip or Intellectual Property (IP) core. The cost of porting the
software to the CPU cannot be ignored. Depending on the application, these
factors may impact the system's viability.

An interesting option is to license a commercial MPEG-1/2 Layer II encoder an IP
Core. This reduces area/volume, weight, and power consumption, allowing the user
to develop a top-notch system and beat the competition. However, to the best of
the author's knowledge, there is only one IP core specifically designed for
MPEG-1/2 Layer I/II Audio in the market, namely the \textit{CWda74}~\cite{xxxx},
later re-branded \textit{IPB-MPEG-SE}~\cite{xxxx}, which uses fixed-point
calculations. Therefore, the market can greatly benefit from more diversity and
competition.

\subsection{Objective}

Therefore, addressing the need for digital audio integrated solutions, and with
the MPEG Layer II (MP2) audio being the base of DAB, this work proposes an IP
core capable of encoding MPEG-1/2 Layer II Audio using floating-point
calculations, and beating the fixed-point CWda74 in terms of accuracy.

The work will be developed using \textit{IObundle, Lda}'s~\cite{iobundle}
IOb-SoC, a System-on-Chip template comprising an open-source RISC-V
processor. The TwoLAME~\cite{twolame} repository, an optimized MPEG Audio Layer
II encoding software based on the ISO/IEC 11172, will provide the
algorithm. Finally, a hardware accelerator will be developed and used as an
IOb-SoC peripheral, in case real-time operation cannot be achieved with the CPU
alone.

\subsection{Report outline}
%describe the contents of each section

This document contains three more sections. The \textbf{Background} section
details the MPEG standard, including its variations, layers, and encoding
process. This section also describes two IP cores, three Chips, and one Software
capable of encoding MPEG Layer I/II. The \textbf{RISC-V-based MPEG-1/2 Layer II
  Encoder} section describes the IOb-Soc and its repository, which will support
the work development. This section also explains the fundamentals of the ISO/IEC
11172 international standard and the Hardware/Software for the proposed IP
core. The \textbf{Work Plan} section delineates the work planning, defining the
goal of each phase and the corresponding schedule.
