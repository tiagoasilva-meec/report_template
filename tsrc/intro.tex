The \textit{Moving Picture Experts Group} (MPEG)~\cite{MPEG} is a working group that sets standards for media coding, established by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)~\cite{iso} and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)~\cite{iec}. Within the professional and consumer market, four fields of applications can be identified, namely broadcasting, storage, multimedia, and telecommunication.

%MPEG, 1 e 2, audio
The MPEG standard includes two variations, MPEG-1 and MPEG-2, with both covering audio and video compression.  Today, MPEG-1 Audio is the most widely compatible lossy audio format in the world. It standardizes the information that an audio encoder must produce to write a bitstream conformant to the standard requirements.  Nonetheless, MPEG-2 Audio is an extension of the first variation, providing lower sampling frequencies, backward compatibility, and a more advanced coding scheme.

%layers
The MPEG standard also differentiates three coding schemes, called Layer I, Layer II, and Layer III, with the first two being the most relevant ones. 
Layer I, the simpler of the two, is characterized by its lower complexity, making it a practical choice for scenarios where computational resources are limited or where a higher degree of compression is required.
On the other hand, Layer II demands a more intricate encoder and decoder setup. This complexity allows it to deliver superior audio quality, making it the preferred option for one-to-many applications where audio fidelity is paramount.
These formats are regulated by the \textit{ISO/IEC 11172} international standard~\cite{11172}, which specifies the coded representation of high-quality audio for storage media.

\subsection{Motivation}

Since its formation in 1988, the MPEG~\cite{MPEG} has made an indelible mark on the transition from analog to digital video and audio. As proof, the annual value of products and services that rely on MPEG standards is approximately 2\% of the world's gross product. Nonetheless, an increasing number of broadcasting applications are based on MPEG technology, such as Digital Satellite System (DSS)~\cite{dss}, Digital Audio Broadcast (DAB)~\cite{dab}, and Digital Video Broadcast (DVB)~\cite{dvb}. 

To integrate an MPEG-1/2 Layer II encoder in a system, there are three available options.\\
One option is buying an encoder chip, like the \textit{CX23415 MPEG-2 Codec}~\cite{cx23415}, the \textit{MPEG-2 Encoder CW-4888}~\cite{cw4888}, or the \textit{Futura II ASI+IP}~\cite{futura}. For the user, this means an additional chip on the board, increasing its area/volume, weight, and power consumption. \\
Another option is to utilize a software encoder, which relies on a Central Processing Unit (CPU). This CPU can be either an existing one available in the system or an additional processor chip or Intellectual Property (IP) core~\cite{ipcore}. Such software encoders are commonplace in commercial embedded processors, with ARM processors being a notable example. However, it's important to consider the cost and effort associated with porting the software to the CPU. Depending on the specific application, this factor may significantly influence both the overall viability and efficiency of the system.\\
Another interesting option is to license a commercial MPEG-1/2 Layer II encoder IP Core. This reduces area/volume, weight, and power consumption, allowing the user to develop a top-notch system and beat the competition. To the best of the author's knowledge, there is only one IP core specifically designed for MPEG-1/2 Layer I/II Audio in the market, namely the \textit{CWda74}~\cite{CWda74}, later re-branded \textit{IPB-MPEG-SE}~\cite{ipb-mpeg-se}, which uses fixed-point calculations. 


The scarcity of IP core alternatives underscores the pressing need for innovation in this domain. Hence, this work represents a pioneering effort in presenting a RISC-V implementation. \\
The RISC-V architecture offers distinct advantages, primarily due to its open specification and the availability of open-source hardware designs. In combination with a hardware accelerator, the RISC-V approach provides specialization and ensures greater energy efficiency, as the tailored hardware accelerator consumes less power, making it well-suited for energy-constrained applications. This combination also leverages parallel processing to enhance encoding speed, particularly valuable for real-time applications. \\
Additionally, the flexibility to customize the RISC-V processor to the specific encoding requirements also ensures optimal resource utilization, while a general CPU may struggle to achieve comparable efficiency.\\
Lastly, by offloading encoding tasks to hardware accelerators, the RISC-V system allows the CPU to manage other critical functions effectively, resulting in a well-balanced resource allocation and improved overall system performance. 
%This combination of RISC-V and hardware accelerators not only enhances energy efficiency and encoding speed but also optimizes resource utilization, making it a compelling solution for a wide range of applications.


%\subsection{Topic overview}
\subsection{Objectives}

This work introduces an MPEG-1/2 Layer II Audio encoder for a RISC-V embedded architecture
featuring a reconfigurable hardware accelerator. The encoder will be developed using \textit{IObundle, Lda}'s~\cite{iobundle} IOb-SoC~\cite{bib:iobsoc-github}, a System-on-Chip template comprising an open-source RISC-V~\cite{riscv} processor. The TwoLAME~\cite{twolamerepo} repository, an open-source MPEG Audio Layer II encoding software based on the ISO/IEC 11172~\cite{11172}, will provide the algorithm.\\
The objectives of this work are the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Port the \textit{TwoLAME}~\cite{bib:twolame} encoder open-source library to the system, using floating-point precision.
    \item Do basic software optimizations.
    \item Profile the \textit{TwoLAME} algorithm while running in FPGA~\cite{fpga}.
    %\item Implement custom instructions in \textit{VexRiscv}~\cite{bib:vexriscv} CPU. 
    \item Use \textit{Versat}~\cite{bib:iobversat} open-source reconfigurable accelerator design tool to accelerate \textit{TwoLAME} algorithm.
    \item Check the requirements for \textit{TwoLAME} real-time encoding.
    \item Beat the fixed-point \textit{CWda74}~\cite{CWda74}.
\end{itemize}

%Finally, a hardware accelerator will be developed and used as an IOb-SoC peripheral, in case real-time operation cannot be achieved with the CPU alone.

%The \textit{TwoLAME} software will be ported to IOb-SoC's CPU (PicoRV32). However, when encoding at the sampling frequency, the system may not finish execution in real time. If this is the case, a peripheral will be developed to accelerate the process bottlenecks.

%In addition, \textit{TwoLAME} uses floating-point arithmetic (FP)~\cite{floatingpoint}, which can make the hardware implementation quite large. Therefore, developing the peripheral with fixed-point arithmetic~\cite{fixedpoint} is plausible.
%In this case, the VexRiscv (RV32IM) CPU could be used, since it includes a floating-point unit (FPU)~\cite{fpu}. To allow transferring data between the CPU and the peripheral (accelerator), two hardware converters (from floating-point/fixed-point to fixed-point/floating-point) are also required.
