The MPEG working group, established by \textit{ISO} and \textit{IEC} in 1988, has been pivotal in the shift from analog to digital video. MPEG technology supports various broadcasting applications, such as DSS, DAB, and DVB, with MPEG-1 Audio being a globally popular lossy audio format. The MPEG standard includes three coding schemes, with Layer I for low-complexity applications and Layer II for one-to-many scenarios.
In System-on-Chip (SoC) development, balancing performance and cost is challenging, especially in audio encoding. This thesis introduces a floating-point MPEG-1/2 Layer II Audio encoder, offering high accuracy at the cost of increased silicon area and power consumption in a market with limited commercial MPEG-1/2 Layer II IP cores.
The software architecture features the \textit{VEXRISCV} CPU in an IOb-SoC setup, using the \textit{TwoLAME} encoding algorithm. Software optimizations, including function simplification and memory reduction, are applied. Profiling with a TIMER peripheral highlights the significant impact of the \textit{psycho\_3\_threshold} function, accounting for 37\% to 64\% of execution time, depending on the input file.
On the hardware side, the \textit{Versat} accelerator is integrated into IOb-SoC to speed up the \textit{psycho\_3\_threshold} function. This involves expanding the AXI interface for communication between \textit{Versat}, RAM, and the CPU. Two hardware accelerators, \textit{spectrum\_search} and \textit{masking\_threshold}, address parts of the \textit{psycho\_3\_threshold} function. The FPGA implementation shows increased Total LUTs and Logic LUTs usage but no change in DSP Blocks, RAMB36, RAMB18, and URAM.
The successful porting of \textit{TwoLAME} and software optimizations highlight the resource utilization impact of \textit{Versat} within the FPGA. Execution time is significantly reduced with the \textit{spectrum\_search} \textit{Versat} accelerator, approaching real-time encoding requirements by accelerating the \textit{psycho\_3\_threshold} function.
Comparing the achieved speedup with real-time encoding requirements shows close alignment for most input files. The first file with fewer frames falls slightly short, while others, especially the worst-case scenario, exhibit promising outcomes.

%This thesis presents a comprehensive exploration of enhancing MPEG-1/2 Layer II audio encoding, leveraging floating-point processing and hardware acceleration, thereby contributing to the diversification of available solutions in a market currently dominated by a single product.
