His professionalism and high standards were instrumental in this work.

I want to express my gratitude to Rúben Teixeira for his assistance in enhancing my understanding of the hardware accelerator matter. His guidance on the practical aspects of this work, including optimization techniques, was immensely helpful, especially during the latter stages.

I am also deeply thankful to my family for their unwavering support and encouragement. Their constant belief in me and encouragement to give my best has been a motivating force throughout my academic journey.
